# Grid-STIX 2.1 Electrical Grid Cybersecurity Ontology
## The Foundational CITADEL Ontology based on STIX 2.1

Grid-STIX is a comprehensive extension of the STIX (Structured Threat Information Expression) 2.1 ontology specifically designed for electrical grid cybersecurity applications. As the foundational ontology for CITADEL (Critical Infrastructure Trustworthy AI Defense and Evaluation Laboratory), Grid-STIX provides a standardized, machine-readable framework for modeling grid assets, operational technology devices, threats, vulnerabilities, supply chain risks, and security relationships in electrical power systems.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Micromamba** for environment management
- **Java runtime** for Robot (sudo apt install default-jre in Ubuntu)
- **Robot Framework** (OWL toolkit) for ontology operations from https://robot.obolibrary.org/ (and in your PATH)
- **xmllint** for XML validation and formatting

### Environment Setup

Create and activate the development environment:

```bash
make init
```

This creates a `grid-stix` conda environment with all required dependencies including:
- Python 3.12
- RDFLib for ontology processing
- NetworkX & Plotly for visualization
- PyGraphviz for advanced layouts
- Black for code formatting
- Security tools (Bandit)

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Code Quality & Formatting

Format all Python and OWL files:
```bash
make format
```

Run quality checks without modifications:
```bash
make lint
```

Run comprehensive security analysis:
```bash
make security
```

### Ontology Operations

**Merge all component ontologies:**
```bash
make merge
```
Creates `grid-stix-2.1-full.owl` with all modules integrated.

**Validate ontology consistency:**
```bash
make check
```
Runs comprehensive validation including:
- Class hierarchy connectivity
- Missing domain/range declarations
- Unresolved type references and broken property mappings
- URI naming conventions (kebab-case for classes/properties)
- Label format consistency (snake_case)
- Property declaration validation
- STIX compliance verification
- Supply chain relationship validation

**Generate interactive visualization:**
```bash
make html
```
Creates `grid-stix.html` with enhanced electrical grid visualization.

**Generate Python STIX classes:**
```bash
make generate
```
Creates complete Python package in `python/grid_stix/` with STIX-compliant classes for all ontology entities.

## Visualization

Generate interactive HTML visualizations to explore the ontology:

```bash
make html
```

This creates `grid-stix.html` with enhanced electrical grid visualization featuring:

- **Color-coded categories**: Infrastructure (blue), Security (red), Supply chain (brown)
- **Interactive hover**: Detailed information about each concept  
- **Hierarchical layout**: Clear visualization of STIX inheritance
- **Professional presentation**: Publication-ready titles and legends


## Validation & Quality Assurance

Comprehensive ontology validation to ensure consistency and compliance:

```bash
make check
```

**Validation Categories:**
- **Structural**: Class hierarchy integrity, relationship consistency
- **Semantic**: Domain/range validation, property inheritance, unresolved type references
- **Syntactic**: URI naming conventions (kebab-case), label formatting (snake_case)
- **Grid-specific**: Power system relationship validation
- **STIX compliance**: Proper inheritance from STIX base classes

## Contributing

When contributing to Grid-STIX:

1. **Development Cycle:**
   ```bash
   # Make your changes to appropriate files
   make format        # Format code and OWL files
   make check         # Comprehensive ontology validation
   make generate      # Generate Python classes
   make html          # Generate updated visualization
   ```

2. **Best Practices:**
   - Use kebab-case for class and property URIs (e.g., `der-device`)
   - Use snake_case for rdfs:label values (e.g., `der_device`)
   - Maintain proper STIX inheritance patterns
   - Add comprehensive comments for new concepts
   - Run `make check` to ensure validation passes

3. **File Organization:**
   - Assets & infrastructure → `ontology/core/grid-stix-2.1-assets.owl`
   - Grid equipment → `ontology/core/grid-stix-2.1-components.owl`
   - Relationships → `ontology/core/grid-stix-2.1-relationships.owl`
   - Declared-vs-observed comparison model → `ontology/core/grid-stix-2.1-declarations.owl`
   - Nuclear safeguards → `ontology/nuclear/grid-stix-2.1-nuclear-safeguards.owl`
   - Vocabularies → `ontology/vocabularies/grid-stix-2.1-vocab.owl`

## Current Ontology Status

- **Classes**: 230+ comprehensive classes including grid assets, zero trust components, and AMI infrastructure

- **Protocols**: 13 ICS/SCADA and grid protocols (DNP3, Modbus, IEC 61850/60870-5/60870-5-104/62351,
  OPC-UA, BACnet, EtherNet/IP, HART, PROFINET, POWERLINK, SERCOS, IEEE C37.118)
- **Zero Trust**: Policy decision points, enforcement points, trust brokers, and continuous monitoring
- **AMI Infrastructure**: Head-end systems, mesh networks, meter data management systems
- **Supply Chain**: Comprehensive supplier risk and verification modeling
- **Nuclear Safeguards**: Reactor/fuel-cycle assets, IAEA safeguards agreement types, and a
  domain-agnostic Declaration/Discrepancy/LifecycleEvent model for comparing declared vs. observed state
- **Python Generation**: Full STIX-compliant Python class generation with all properties
